NabBot gives no answer. \u00b6 In order for im to work, you need to first configure a world for yor server. This can be done using the command settings world . For the moment, only one world can be configured per server. __________ doesn't look well or doesn't work on mobile \u00b6 The Android and iOS versions of Discord are really behind the web or standalone client, so NabBot is focused on desktop users. If we limit ourselves to the mobile versions we would be slowing down the development of NabBot. Why does ________ command shows scrambled text when switching pages? \u00b6 This is a discord bug that has been present for a while. Only happens on desktop. If text looks scrambled, you can switch to another channel and switch back and the content will be fixed. Why am I not seeing deaths and level ups for characters in the watched list? \u00b6 Only characters registered through im get their level ups and deaths tracked. For the moment, the watch list is only to display their online status in the game. Self Hosting \u00b6 Note In order to run and manage NabBot, basic knowledge of Python is expected. I can't run NabBot, python is not found. \u00b6 If you get an error like this: \u201cpython\u201d is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. , it can be due to one of these reasons: * Python is not installed. To install visit Python.org * The python folder is not in the PATH enviroment variable. This is prompted when installing Python. My world is getting merged, what do I do? \u00b6 NabBot can't detect world merges, so you have to run the /merge command to change all content of the old world to the new one: Someone got a namechange, what now? \u00b6 Name changes are automatically updated by NabBot, so nothing needs to be done here, the character will be updated automatically the first time he is checked. Namelocks are more complicated. What do I do with namelocked characters? \u00b6 Because of the way namelocks work, all references lost to the old name are completely gone on tibia.com, so it's nearly impossible to detect this change, resulting in people just registering their new character and ending with duplicates. To fix this, a server administrator can use the namelock command: /namelock Oldname,Newname If new name was already registered again, this will merge both character entries into one. Otherwise, it will just rename Oldname to new name. Since there's no way to check this, this should be done with care. The only thing that NabBot can verify is that their vocations match. /merge Fidera Gladera This will tell the bot that Fidera has merged into Gladera , changing all references of Fidera to Gladera. Note that this change be irreversible, so this must be used under your own risk. It's recommended to do this right after the server save that will merge the worlds. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Can you help me or make a cavebot/macro? \u00b6 No. How can I make NabBot work for this OT server? \u00b6 NabBot was made to work specifically for Tibia, it depends completely on the layout of Tibia.com so even if the URLs were changed to an OT's website, the code used to parse information would have to be changed. However, if you're an OT owner, an API could be easily developed to let NabBot extract information more efficiently and even show a lot of extra information that is not available in Tibia.com","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"faq/#why-is-im-not-working-nabbot-gives-no-answer","text":"In order for im to work, you need to first configure a world for yor server.

If you just invited NabBot to your server, you don't need to read this. Installing requirements \u00b6 In order to run NabBot, you need to install two things: Python 3.6+ and PostgreSQL 10+ When installing on Windows, make sure that you select the option to add Python to PATH . Once installed, you need to find what's the python's executable name, depending on the installation, it can be either python , python3 or py . Once the correct command has been found, open a terminal window on NabBot's root directory and run the following: python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt Installing PostgreSQL \u00b6 Since v2.0.0, NabBot uses PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for data storage. This means you must be running a PostgreSQL service. It is recommended to run it on the same machine. Once it is installed and running, you must create a database and a user for NabBot to access. You can use the default root user, but this is not recommended. You can create them using any tool you want. Here's an example using psql : CREATE ROLE nabbot WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'hunter2' ; CREATE DATABASE nabbot OWNER nabbot ; Creating an Application \u00b6 In order to run a Discord bot, you need to create a new application. Go to My Apps in the developers portal. Once you're here, click on the New App button. Fill the fields, Click on Create App once you're done. Now that you have created your App, look for the Create a Bot User button. You're going to need two things from here, your Client ID , found at the top, and your Token , found in the Bot section. Your Client ID should look like 391624006744145920 and your token like MzkxNjI0MDA2NzQ0MTQ1OTIw.DRbYSQ.EbWIRWMqEQCYSBhlnNpG7FQLwZs Warning Your token is secret, never expose it to anyone. Anyone with access to your token can run a bot as you, compromising your account. If Discord's Terms of Service are broken using your bot, your account will pay the consequences. Running your bot \u00b6 To run your bot, you need to execute launcher.py . The first time you run NabBot, you will be asked for your connection credentials to PostgreSQL. Here's where you will provide the information created earlier. After that, you will be asked for your token. Here's where you will use the token given on the App page. Once you entered the token, the bot will log in. You should see a dialog showing that the bot is now online. Migrating from v1.x.x \u00b6 If you were running a previous version of NabBot before and you want to migrate your data, you need to run the migrate console command. python launcher.py migrate By default, it will look for the database in the path data/users.db , but you can provide a different path using the --path argument: python launcher.py migrate --path data/database-backup.db Depending on the size of your previous database, this may take a couple of minutes. Warning Doing this will delete all the data currently found in your PostgreSQL database. Your SQLite data will be unaffected by this operation. Inviting your bot \u00b6 To invite your bot to your server, you need to use the authentication URL. Here's where your Client ID is used. https : // discordapp . com / oauth2 / authorize?scope = bot & permissions = 268954832 & client_id = CLIENT_ID_HERE Info Make sure you don't deny any of the permissions requested as they are necessary for NabBot. For detailed explanation on NabBot's permissions, see the Permissions section. You should now see your bot online on your server. Depending on your privacy settings, you (or the owner of the server) should have received a DM by NabBot explaining how to do the inital configuration. Initial configuration \u00b6 In order for the bot to have access to most of its features, you must configure the world the server tracks. Use the command settings world , for example: /settings world Gladera . Then the bot will ask for confirmation. Once accepted, users can start registering their characters using /im charName . By default, events, level ups and deaths announcements are made on the highest channel available for the bot. In order to customize this, you can use the following commands: /settings levelschannel . The bot usually shortens command replies on public channels to reduce spam a bit. Commands used via DM display more information. Alternatively, you can create a channel named #ask-nabbot . The bot will give longer responses here and it will delete any message that is not a command, leaving this as a channel dedicated to commands. Additionally, you can create a channel named #server-log . Whenever a user registers characters, they will be shown here, along with their levels and guilds. Other changes are shown here, such as users leaving, getting banned, changing display names and more. Further customization can be done on a per-server basis by using the command settings .","title":"Install Guide"},{"location":"install/#installation-guide","text":"Info This information is only for users hosting NabBot on their own.

To operate correctly, the bot needs the following permissions. Required permissions \u00b6 Read Messages \u00b6 This permission is needed for obvious reasons. If the bot can't read messages, it can't respond to commands. If this permission is not set for a channel, the bot won't even appear on the online list on that channel. This permission can be denied for specific channel if you don't want it to be on that channel. If this permission is denied, all other permissions are considered denied automatically. Send Messages \u00b6 An obligatory permission. The bot needs this to be able to respond to commands and make announcements. Add Reactions \u00b6 This permission is needed in order for command pagination to work. Read Message History \u00b6 Due to a Discord API limitation, the bot must be able to read message history in order to be able to know when a message has been reacted to in paginating commands. Manage Messages \u00b6 This permission lets the bot delete other people messages and reactions. This is used for the ask channel so the bot can remove messages that are not commands. This is also needed for command pagination so the bot can remove the user's reaction so they can react again easily. Embed Links \u00b6 Many commands feature Discord embeds. These are rich format replies that allow the use of masked links, thumbnails, time stamps, fields, etcetera. Denying this permission makes such commands stop working. Use External Emojis \u00b6 This permission is needed for NabBot to be able to display its custom emojis. Recommended permissions \u00b6 Attach Files \u00b6 This permission allows the bot to attach files as part of the message. Some commands like /item , /monster and /house display a related image. Disabling this permission won't break those commands functionality but images won't be shown anymore. View Audit Log \u00b6 It lets the bot check the audit log for more information when a member leaves, is banned or changes nickname. With this, the bot is able to tell if a member was kicked or left the server on his own, or if they updated their nickname or someone edited it for them. This is only relevant for servers that have a #server-log channel. Manage Channels \u00b6 This permission is only needed if you're using the watched-list feature. It lets the bot create the channel and update it's status.

All commands require a prefix in order to be recognized and to avoid command triggering accidentally. By default, the command prefix is / and @NabBot , this can be changed in the main file by changing command_prefix , or per server using the command settings prefix . Commands can be used on any channel where the bot can read and write. Some commands may require extra permissions such as Embed Links or Attach Files , or might not be allowed in private messages. Some commands can show longer responses if used in ask-channel (by default, #ask-nabbot). For descriptions of each command check the different commands sections in the sidebar. In discord, you can use the command help to see a list of commands. Only commands that you are allowed to use will be shown. Paginator \u00b6 Some commands responses feature a paginator ( based on RoboDany's paginator class ). These can be easily spotted by the reactions automatically added to the reply (\u25c0\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f\u23f9\ufe0f). These reactions act as buttons, letting you scroll through the results. When you click on one of the arrow reactions, the page is scrolled in that direction and your reaction is removed so you can use it again. Using the stop reaction removes the paginating interface. Only the user that used the command can turn the pages. Note When used in private messages, the bot has no way of removing your reactions, so you must remove them and add them yourself again. Vocation Filter \u00b6 Some commands, allow you to filter their character list by vocation. Allowing you to easily find a certain vocation. Similar to Paginator, they have reaction buttons to switch pages (\u25c0\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f\u23f9\ufe0f).

Admins are members with the Administrator permission. Info Parameters are enclosed with < > . Optional parameters are enclosed in brackets [] . checkchannel \u00b6 Syntax: checkchannel [channel] Checks the channel's permissions. Makes sure that the bot has all the required permissions to work properly. If no channel is specified, the current one is checked. Examples /checkchannel settings \u00b6 Shows the available server-specific settings that can be modified. Examples /settings settings askchannel \u00b6 Syntax: settings askchannel [channel] Other aliases: settings commandchannel Changes the channel where longer replies for commands are given. In this channel, pagination commands show more entries at once and command replies in general are longer. settings commandsonly \u00b6 Syntax: settings commandsonly [yes/no] Sets whether only commands are allowed in the command channel. If this is enabled, everything that is not a message will be deleted from the command channel. This allows the channel to be used exclusively for commands. If the channel is shared with other command bots, this should be off. Note that the bot needs Manage Messages permission to delete messages. settings defaultannouncements \u00b6 Syntax: settings defaultannouncements [yes/no] Other aliases: settings simpleannouncements Sets whether simple level/death messages will be used instead of random custom messages. When enabled, all level up and death messages will be the same, a simple and short message. settings eventschannel \u00b6 Syntax: settings eventschannel [channel] Changes the channel where upcoming events are announced. This is where announcements of events about to happen will be made. If the assigned channel is deleted or forbidden, the top channel will be used. If this is disabled, users that subscribed to the event will still receive notifications via PM. settings levelschannel \u00b6 Syntax: settings levelschannel [channel] Other aliases: settings deathschannel , settings trackingchannel Changes the channel where levelup and deaths are announced. This is were all level ups and deaths of registered characters will be announced. By default, the highest channel on the list where the bot can send messages will be used. If the assigned channel is deleted or forbidden, the top channel will be used again. If this is disabled, Announcements won't be made, but there will still be tracking. settings minlevel \u00b6 Syntax: settings minlevel [level] Other aliases: settings announcelevel Changes the minimum level from which NabBot starts to announce level ups and deaths. Level ups and deaths under the minimum level are still tracked and can be seen by checking the character directly. settings newschannel \u00b6 Syntax: settings newschannel [channel] Changes the channel where Tibia news are announced. This is where all news and articles posted in Tibia.com will be announced. If the assigned channel is deleted or forbidden, the top channel will be used. settings prefix \u00b6 Syntax: settings prefix [prefix] Changes the command prefix for this server. The prefix are the characters that go before a command's name, in order for the bot to recognize the command. A maximum of 5 commands can be set per server. To remove an existing prefix, use it as a parameter. If you want to have a space at the end, such as: nabbot help , you have to use double quotes \"nabbot \". Multiple words also require using quotes. Mentioning the bot is always a valid command and can't be changed. settings serverlog \u00b6 Syntax: settings prefix [prefix] Changes the channel used as the server log. By default, a channel named server-log will be used. In this channel, character registrations and server changes are announced. settings welcome \u00b6 Syntax: settings welcome [message] Changes the message new members receive when joining.

Example /leave 159815897052086272 load \u00b6 Syntax: load <cog> Loads a cog. If there's an error while compiling, it will be displayed here. Any cog can be loaded here, including cogs made by user. When loading and unloading cogs in subdirectories, periods ( . ) are used instead of slashes ( / ). For example, a cog found in cogs/tibia.py would be loaded as cogs.tibia . Example /load cogs.tibia merge \u00b6 Syntax: merge <old world> <new world> Renames all references of an old world to a new one. This command should updates all the database entries, changing all references of the old world to the new one This updates all characters' worlds and discord guild's tracked worlds to the new world. All the highscores entries of the old world will be deleted. This should be done immediately after the world merge occurs and not before, or else tracking will stop. Use this with caution as the damage can be irreversible. Example: merge Fidera Gladera Example /merge Fidera Gladera namelock \u00b6 Syntax: namelock <old name>,<new name> Other aliases: rename , namechange Register the name of a new character that was namelocked. Characters that get namelocked can't be searched by their old name, so they must be reassigned manually. If the character got a name change (from the store), searching the old name redirects to the new name, so these are usually reassigned automatically. In order for the command to work, the following conditions must be met: The old name must exist in NabBot's characters database. The old name must not be a valid character in Tibia.com The new name must be a valid character in Tibia.com They must have the same vocation, not considering promotions. ping \u00b6 Show's the bot's response times. Example /ping reload \u00b6 Reloads a cog (module) Example /reload cogs.tibia reloadconfig \u00b6 Reloads the configuration file. Example /reloadconfig repl \u00b6 Starts a REPL session in the current channel. Similar to /debug , except this keep an open session where variables are stored. To exit, type exit() . Warning This command is meant for advanced users and debugging code. servers \u00b6 Shows a list of servers the bot is in. Further information can be obtained using serverinfo [id] . Values can be sorted by using one of the following values for sort: name members world created joined Example /servers shutdown \u00b6 Shutdowns the bot. sql \u00b6 Syntax: sql <query> Executes a SQL query and shows the results. If the results are too long to display, a text file is generated and uploaded. Example /sql SELECT * FROM chars WHERE user_id = 162060569803751424 unload \u00b6 Syntax: unload <cog> Unloads a cog. Note Unloading cogs.owner would remove the /load command, making it impossible to reload cogs until restarting the bot. Example /unload cogs.tibia versions \u00b6 Shows NabBot's version and the versions of all dependencies. This command can be useful to find out why the bot is not behaving as it should or for submitting bug reports. Currently, discord.py's version can't be controlled because an unreleased version is being used. This will change once v1.0.0 is finally released. For every dependency, an emoji indicates if the requirement is met: \u2705 Indicates that the installed version is in the required range. \u274c Indicates that the installed version is under the required range. This means some features may not be available. \u2757 Indicates that the installed version is higher than the required range.

To see the related commands check the Roles commands . These features require the bot to have Manage Roles permission, as this is required to be able to add and remove roles. Only users with Manage Roles permissions can edit and check rules, and they can't edit any rules for roles higher than theirs. Adding rules \u00b6 Automatic roles work based on rules. A rule consist of a role and a guild. When a user has a registered character in a guild contained in a rule, the role is added. If that character leaves the guild or the user unregisters the character, their role will be removed, unless they met another rule for that role. Rules can be added by using autorole add . The command takes two parameters: A role and a guild. Examples /autorole add @Redd Alliance Redd Alliance \u2013 Members of Redd Alliance will receive the role @Redd Alliance . Note that @Redd Alliance must be mentionable to be added this way, and it will ping all role members. /autorole add 162767187474513920 Redd Retreat \u2013 Members of Redd Retreat will receive the role with id 162767187474513920 . Role ids can be obtained by using roleinfo . /autorole add \"Bald Dwarfs\" Bald Dwarfs \u2013 Members of Bald Dwarfs will receive the role @Bald Dwarfs . Note that since the role name contains multiple words, it must be quoted. Guilds never need to be quoted. /autorole add Identified * \u2013 Any user that has registered character will be given the @Identified role. You can have as many rules as you want, for as many roles or guilds as needed, as long as they're not repeated. It is also possible to have multiple rules for the same roles. In practice, this can be used to have a @Allies role. All the allied guilds would be added to the same role. The list of rules can be checked using autorole list . Applying rules \u00b6 Once the rules have been set, NabBot will start enforcing them whenever certain triggers are actioned: A new member joins the server, with previously registered characters. A member uses /im to register characters. A member uses /imnot to unregister characters. A registered character is checked using /whois and a guild change is detected. A registered character is checked while online in the level and deaths tracking process. Limitations \u00b6 If a rule is removed, there's currently no way to \"undo\" that rule, e.g. if the rule for @Guildies is removed, NabBot won't remove the role from any users, unless there's another rule involving that rule that they don't meet. Unless checked using /whois , there is no way to apply rules to characters that haven't been online in a while. Meaning that an old inactive member that was kicked from a guild, won't have their role removed until they log in or they are check with /whois . If an automatic role is assigned/removed manually by someone, the bot might remove/reassign it again when the character is checked. Newly added rules are not applied for existing members until a character change is detected. Using autorole refresh will check all members again. Note that this won't update characters that haven't been online in a while.

The log channel is a special channel where NabBot posts server events such as members joining, leaving or getting banned. The bot will announce the following events here: A new member joined, with a list of their previously registered characters, if available A member left or was kicked (if the bot has View Audit Log permission, it can tell the difference) A member was banned A member changed his name or nick.
